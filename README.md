# Pong
Pong, written in Haskell using gloss

# How to run
 * Build the game using `cabal build`
 * Run the game using `cabal run`
   * Make sure you have `glut32.dll` installed on your system and on the system PATH

Maybe soon I'll try to upload a build that comes with glut32

# How to play
Use `W` and `S` to navigate the menu, and `Space` to select.  
Press `Space` to start the game.  
Use `W` and `S` to move your paddle up and down respectively.
